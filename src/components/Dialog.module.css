        The dialog defaults to delegating its size to its contents,
        which is generally great.
        My goal here is to constrain the max-inline-size to a readable size 60ch or 90% of the viewport width.
        This ensures the dialog won't go edge to edge on a mobile device,
        and won't be so wide on a desktop screen that it's hard to read.

        The softness is achieved by rounding the corners of the dialog.
        The depth is achieved with one of Open Propsâ€™ carefully crafted shadow props.
